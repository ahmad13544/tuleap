# Tracker constants

This module contains all the Tracker constants, such as the types of fields (`"sb"`, `"msb"`, and so on), the types of list binds (`"static"`, `"users"`, `"ugroups"`), the types of Text field formats (`"text"`, `"html"`, `"commonmark"`), the permissions (`"read"`, `"create"`, `"update"`).
It exports types so that it is easier to be strict about those constants.
